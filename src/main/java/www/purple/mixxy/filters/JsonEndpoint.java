/**
 * Filter that makes a Controller method double as a Web endpoint (for users) and a JSON endpoint
 * (for data). This way we can have an API without having to implement extra controllers or
 * controller methods. After all, if {@code curl} and Google Chrome are asking for the same data,
 * why not give it to them with the same code?
 * 
 * If the pattern for a {@link Route} to an endpoint with this annotation begins with
 * {@code "/api/"}, the endpoint method will return JSON. Otherwise, this {@link Filter} does
 * nothing.
 * 
 * When writing a method annotated with this {@link Filter}, pass the relevant data to the
 * {@link Result} object and let the view do the rest!
