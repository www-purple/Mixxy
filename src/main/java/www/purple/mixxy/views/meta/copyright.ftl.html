    <p>www.purple respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same.</p>

    <p>
      In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (<q>DMCA</q>), the text of which may be found on
      the U.S. Copyright Office website <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/pl105-304.pdf">here</a>, and other
      applicable laws, www.purple has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole
      discretion, the accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. www.purple may also, at its sole
      discretion, limit access to www.purple's website and services (collectively, <q>Service</q>) and/or terminate the
      accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat
      infringement. www.purple will respond to claims of copyright infringement committed on the www.purple website that
      are reported to www.purple's Designated Copyright Agent, identified in the sample notice below.
    </p>

    <p>If you knowingly misrepresent in your notification that the material or activity is infringing, you will be
      liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer as the result
      of our relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to
      be infringing.</p>

    <p>If you are a copyright owner, or are authorized to act on behalf of one, or authorized to act under any
      exclusive right under copyright, please report alleged copyright infringements taking place on or through the
      Services by completing the following DMCA Notice of Alleged Infringement and delivering it to www.purple's
      Designated Copyright Agent. Upon receipt of the Notice as described below, www.purple will take whatever action,
      in its sole discretion, it deems appropriate, including removal of the challenged material from the Services.</p>
