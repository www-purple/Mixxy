            <p>www.purple respects the intellectual property rights of others and

            <p>
                In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (<q>DMCA</q>),
                the text of which may be found on the U.S. Copyright Office website <a
                    href="http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/pl105-304.pdf">here</a>, and
                other applicable laws, www.purple has adopted a policy of terminating, in
                appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, the accounts of users
                who are deemed to be repeat infringers. www.purple may also, at its sole
                discretion, limit access to www.purple's website and services (collectively, <q>Service</q>)
                and/or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual
                property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.
                www.purple will respond to claims of copyright infringement committed on the
                www.purple website that are reported to www.purple's Designated Copyright
                Agent, identified in the sample notice below.
            </p>

            <p>If you knowingly misrepresent in your notification that the material or
                activity is infringing, you will be liable for any damages, including costs
                and attorneys' fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer as the result of
                our relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the
                material or activity claimed to be infringing.</p>

            <p>If you are a copyright owner, or are authorized to act on behalf of one,
                or authorized to act under any exclusive right under copyright, please report
                alleged copyright infringements taking place on or through the Services by

                described below, www.purple will take whatever action, in its sole discretion,
                it deems appropriate, including removal of the challenged material from the
                Services.</p>
